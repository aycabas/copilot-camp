## Introduction

Declarative agents are personalised Copilots that you can use to create a more contextual and tailored expereince for your specific needs. They are developed by providing _instructions, knowledge and skills_. In this lab we will focus on the **instructions** part of the agent. If you need to learn more about _knowledge and skills_ head to our [labs](https://microsoft.github.io/copilot-camp/pages/extend-m365-copilot/) that deep dives into those features. 

In this lab you will create an agent that will help you choose the show you want to watch this weekend on Netflix.
We start with a simple prompt and iteratively try and improve the instructions. 

## Step 1: Identify the problem for AI assitant

**Problem:** There are findings, stating that an average person spends approximately 110 hours annually scrolling through menus of various streaming apps like Netflix, Prime Video, Apple TV+, and Disney+ Hotstar. When considered in context, this means people spend an entire working week per year just checking various streaming apps without interruptions.

**Solution:** Consider implementing a Copilot agent that can streamline decision-makeing processes.
