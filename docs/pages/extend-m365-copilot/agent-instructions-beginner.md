# Lab Declarative Agent Instruction - Improve your agent instructions (Beginner friendly)

What you will do:
  
- **Identify the Problem:** Pinpoint the specific issue your copilot agent will address 
- **Build a Basic Agent:** Start with a simple prompt to get your agent up and running. 
- **Define the Agent's Role:** Improve your agents focus with a role assigned 
- **Outline Execution Steps:** Break down the process into clear, manageable subtasks. 
- **Set Response Guidelines:** Influence the agent’s response with clear instructions 
- **Give example conversations:** Provide examples to improve consistency in agent’s response 

 

This lab will guide you with suggestions to help refine your agent instructions approach drawing from techniques we have experimented over time. These practices have generally contributed to enhancing our agent's behaviour and consistency. 

???+ info "Prerequisites"
    - Access to Copilot either using Teams, Microsoft 356 chat or Copilot chat
    - A tool to iteratively test and update your agent either Teams Toolkit or Agent builder or Copilot Studio 
    (This lab uses Teams Toolkit, but you can also test it in Agent builder or even Copilot Studio)

## Introduction

Declarative agents are personalised Copilots that you can use to create a more contextual and tailored expereince for your specific needs. They are developed by providing _instructions, knowledge and skills_. In this lab we will focus on the **instructions** part of the agent. If you need to learn more about _knowledge and skills_ head to our [labs](https://microsoft.github.io/copilot-camp/pages/extend-m365-copilot/) that deep dives into those features. 

In this lab we will create a Declarative Agent called **ShowExpert** which is a `Generative Recommendation agent`.  
Such Generative Recommendation agents are designed to enhance decision-making, improve customer experiences, and streamline operations. Here, we will build an agent that provides tailored recommendations for shows in the online streaming platforms. 
While our "ShowExpert" agent helps users quickly decide what to watch, the same principles provide significant enterprise value through their ability to streamline operations and enhance decision-making processes. These systems unlock competitive advantages across multiple dimensions: 

- **Enhanced decision** quality by synthesising insights from vast datasets and surfacing hidden patterns 
- **Operational efficiency** through automation of complex information analysis 
- **Personalisation** at scale with real-time adaptation to changing preferences 
- **Knowledge democratization** by providing domain expertise to everyone  

We start with a simple prompt and iteratively try and improve the instructions. Evaluating the agent's behaviour at every iteration of instructions is crucial. We will conduct iterative cycles to refine the instructions until we achieve a somewhat consistent behaviour from the agent. 

![Improvement cycle](../../assets/images/extend-m365-copilot-a1/improvement-cycle.png)

## Step 1: Identify the Problem for Agent  

**Problem:** There are findings, stating that an average person spends approximately 110 hours annually scrolling through menus of various online streaming platforms for shows. When considered in context, this means people spend an entire working week per year just checking various streaming apps without interruptions. 

**Solution:** Consider implementing a Copilot agent that can streamline decision-making processes. Let’s call it the **ShowExpert**. 

**Goal:** It helps to already have an end goal in mind for the **ShowExpert**. It should be interactive, friendly, will ask for preferences, and give me detailed information about the shows it recommends and why it thinks I should watch it. Just like a friend. 

![Decision cycle](../../assets/images/extend-m365-copilot-a1/decision-cycle.png)

## Step 2: Build a first Basic Agent (Declarative Agent) 

The first step is to think of an initial prompt for this agent given as its instruction. Our examination of the community's prompting techniques, facilitated by the [Copilot Prompt Library](https://aka.ms/copilot-prompt-library), has revealed that most people start with single line prompts.  

So, let's start off with the basic prompt below:

```
You are an agent to help user with recommendation for shows that are streaming on online streaming platforms 
```

Now to build ShowExpert, you can use any tool of your choice like Teams Toolkit, Agent Builder or Copilot Studio. In this lab we have used Teams Toolkit. Check out our [prerequisites lab](http://127.0.0.1:8000/copilot-camp/pages/extend-m365-copilot/00-prerequisites/) to understand how to set up your environment for testing using Teams Toolkit. 

### Declarative agent using Teams Toolkit


???+ info "About this step"
     This step in the lab assumes you have installed Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio Code and is going to use this extension to create a declarative agent. If you are going to use Agent Builder or Copilot Studio, these steps won’t be needed. Use the tool of your choice and paste instructions in the `Instructions` column instead and test it out. Here is a lab that shows you below steps to create a [declarative agent](https://microsoft.github.io/copilot-camp/pages/extend-m365-copilot/01-declarative-copilot/) in detail.

- Go to the Teams Toolkit extension in your Visual Studio Code editor and select **Create a New App**
- A panel opens up where you need to select **Declarative Agent** from the list of project types.
- Select **No Action** next
- Choose the project root folder for your agent project
- Give an application name like : "ShowExpert" and enter
- A VS code window will open up with your agent project scaffolded.
- Expand **appPackage** folder. This is you will work to update your agent. 
- (Optional) Replace the **color.png** with an icon of your choice with 192x192 size. Here is an example [file](../../assets/images/extend-m365-copilot-a1/color.png).
- Go to file **declarativeAgent.json** and locate _description_ object. This is where you will set your persona for your agent for Copilot. Paste a simple description like `Recommendation agent for online streaming platforms' shows` for now. 
- In the same file **declarativeAgent.json**, after the _instructions_ object, add the capability for your agent to use websearch by appending below code after a comma. 

```
 "capabilities": [
        {

            "name": "WebSearch"
        
        }
    ]
```

- Go to **instruction.txt** file and replace the placeholder instruction with our basic prompt `You are an agent to help user with recommendation for shows that are streaming on online streaming platforms`


Now you are ready to test the basic prompt.

- Go to the Teams Toolkit extension in your Visual Studio Code editor and select **Provision** under **LifeCycle**. This step will sideload your agent to Microsoft 365 available for you test.
- Go to teams app or Microsoft 365 chat.
- Open Copilot app
- Inside Copilot app, locate the "ShowExpert" agent from the right panel and select for an immersive chat experience with the agent. 

Initiate chat by saying `Hi` or ask the question right away in chat - e.g `Suggest a show to watch today on Netflix`.

Below shows the interaction with the agent.


![Basic prompt agent interaction](../../assets/images/extend-m365-copilot-a1/step1-basic-prompt.png)

While this agent did its job it is far from our end goal. So, like mentioned in the intro let's try and improve its behaviour. 

## Step 3: Identify and assign a role/purpose to your agent
Now let's give our agent a role and a purpose. Much like humans , agents are motivated when they are given their life's purpose! 

The way to look at it is to think of instructing a child of 7 years of age how to do something, like emptying the trash can. You might say something like this to the kid - _"**You are Captain Clean-up, the superhero tasked with saving the house from the stinky trash monster in the kitchen!**"_

The Copilot agents are very smart,  but they are also unaware of the task at hand. So, giving them a role similar to giving a child instruction to do a task would help.
This is also the persona of the agent, so we will not only put the role in the instructions but also make this the description of the agent.

Copy and paste below text to `description` field in **declarativeAgent.json** as well as the whole text for **instruction.txt**

```
You are an agent specialised in providing reviews and recommendations for shows on all online streaming platforms. Your primary goal is to help users discover content they'll enjoy and make informed decisions about what to watch. Speak concretely about all angles, pros and cons in an unbiased yet informative manner about the shows.Extract the user's name and greet them personally.  
```
Once changes are made, select **Provision** to update the agent. 

### Testing the modification

Open a new chat with the **ShowExpert** and interact the same way as before. Below shows the interaction with the agent. 


![Role provided agent interaction](../../assets/images/extend-m365-copilot-a1/step2-role.png)

As you can see the agent is friendlier and slightly gives us general review of what is popular these days with its own recommendations. It has made more informed decision on behalf of the user. This is a good improvement but has not reached the goal yet so let's keep improving. 

## Step 4: Execution for sequential subtasks if relevant

When you take the example of explaining the role of Captain clean up, you could make it a lot easier for the child to do the task successfully if you provide steps to do the task. Just like the child, agents also behave better when you give them steps or execution steps (if at all the task at hand involves steps) when needed. For the case of captain clean up you could say - _"**You are Captain Clean-up. You have a special mission to keep the house safe from the trash monster in the kitchen. Carefully pull out the trash bag from the bin. Use your superhero strength to make sure nothing falls out. Open the lid of the big garbage bin and put the trash bag inside. Make sure it's all the way in. Close the lid of the big garbage bin. You've completed your mission and saved the house from the stinky trash monster**_

Certainly, this is a sequence that can be made into execution steps. 
Now let's reimage for our ShowExpert agent how to incorporate subtasks as steps.

Add into the **instruction.txt** file below Execution Steps

???+ info "Format of instruction file"
    Agents behave better when instruction files are in .md format

```
## Execution Steps

1. Extract the user's name and greet them personally. Use emojis and be welcoming.
2. Identify the type of request (review, recommendation, or question).
3. List key elements from the user's input (e.g., shows mentioned, preferences).
4. For recommendations (suggestions), brainstorm potential shows before making final selections, ask questions to clarify preferences.
5. Evaluate how well potential recommendations match the user's preferences.
```
Once changes are made, select **Provision** to update the agent. 

![worflow interaction with agent](../../assets/images/extend-m365-copilot-a1/step3-wf.png)

As you can see the agent interaction has improved, it knows the name of the user, uses emojis a lot more, gives details of the shows, asks for preferences and genre in the end etc. It is a lot better, but it could be improved as per our goal. 


## Step 5: Guidelines for Response, Tone and miscellaneous

Giving our agent guidelines on how it's response should be formed, what tone to give, what to keep in mind etc. are all good ways to improve the behaviour of your agent as you see fit. In our case there is response format we have as goal, we know what tone the agent should use and we also want to enforce some other principals. We are going to call it  `Operating Principals`.

We can put these operating principals right above the execution steps. 

```
## Operating Principles

Your final response to the user, formatted according to the guidelines below:

### Guidelines for different types of {task}:
1. Show Reviews:
- Basic show information (release year, genres, creator, runtime)
- IMDB rating using star emoji
- Critic consensus summary with 2-3 representative quotes
- Audience reception data and common viewer opinions
- Content warnings or age appropriateness information (when relevant)
- Tailored recommendation on whether the user might enjoy the show

2. Recommendations:
- Basic show information (release year, genres, creator, runtime)
- 2-3 highly relevant options based on user preferences and viewing history
- IMDB rating using star emoji
- Brief explanation of why each show is recommended
- Consider genre preferences, themes, and specific elements the user enjoys

3. Answering Questions:
- Provide concise, accurate information about show content, cast, or production details
- If the question is unclear, ask for clarification
- If the information is not available or you're unsure, be honest about limitations

### Tone
Always maintain a conversational and friendly tone while remaining professional. Use concise language that emphasizes key information. Respect user opinions even when they differ from critical consensus.

### Privacy and Limitations:
- Only use information the user has voluntarily shared
- Don't make assumptions about personal information
- Inform users when information about very recent releases might be limited
- Be transparent when recommendations are based on limited user preference data
- Remind users that you don't have direct access to their Netflix account
```

Once changes are made, select **Provision** to update the agent. 

![interaction with improved response guidelines ](../../assets/images/extend-m365-copilot-a1/step4-response-guidelines.png)

A lot has improved here. The agent is friendly, engages for preferences, still actively recommends shows. It has formatted it's recommendations to include details of the movie, rating, and why the user might like it. I still want to re-enforce some behaviour like the brainstorming part. 

## Step 6: Examples, Examples, Examples

The best way to get to respond like your goals is to provide as many examples as possible you can of your ideal interaction with the agent. Include at the very least 2 examples. The more complex your tasks, the more examples, especially if your steps needs to use multi turn conversation between user and agent. 

For our agent, we want to make sure we add examples to make sure we get the response and interaction we have as a goal. 

Paste the below and append it to the existing instruction in file **instruction.txt**

```

## Example Interactions:

## Step 7: Fine tune your own way

All steps for this lab are now complete, and you have an agent that exhibits somewhat consistent behaviour. The final step is optional, but what would you add to enhance this agent further? Let us know! 

!!! note
    Restrict your instructions to a total length of 8000 characters.

## Key take-aways
Do not settle for simple line prompts if your agents have complex tasks at hand. Fine-tuning an agent enhances consistency and predictability in responses. It also significantly improves the agent's functionality and behaviour. The process involves trial and error to craft effective instructions. When implemented well, these agents become valuable collaborative tools that augment human capabilities.
