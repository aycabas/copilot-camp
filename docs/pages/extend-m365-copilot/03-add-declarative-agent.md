In this lab you will add a declarative agent which is grounded in the API plugin you created in the previous lab, as well as in specific SharePoint files

!!! note
    This lab builds on the previous one, Lab E2. You should be able to continue working in the same folder for labs E2-E6, but solution folders have been provided for your reference.
    The finished solution for this lab is in the [**/src/extend-m365-copilot/path-e-lab03-build-declarative-agent/trey-research-lab03-END**](https://github.com/microsoft/copilot-camp/tree/main/src/extend-m365-copilot/path-e-lab03-build-declarative-agent/trey-research-lab03-END){target=_blank} folder.

## Exercise 1: Upload sample documents

In this step you will upload sample documents which will be used by your declarative agent to respond to user prompts. These include some consulting documents such as Statements of Work, and a simple spreadsheet containing your hours as a consultant.

### Step 1: Create a SharePoint site

Within the [Microsoft 365 app](https://www.office.com/){target=_blank}, or elsewhere in Microsoft 365, click the "waffle" menu 1️⃣ and select "SharePoint" 2️⃣.

![The UI of Microsoft 365 with the waffle menu expanded and the SharePoint workload highlighted.](../../assets/images/extend-m365-copilot-05/upload-docs-01.png)

Then click "Create Site" 1️⃣ and choose a "Team site" 2️⃣.

![The UI to create a new SharePoint Online site, with 'Team Site' template suggested.](../../assets/images/extend-m365-copilot-05/upload-docs-02.png)

Select the Standard team site template; you will be shown a preview of the site. Click "Use Template" to continue.

![The UI to select the 'Standard' site template for the target site.](../../assets/images/extend-m365-copilot-05/upload-docs-03.png)

Give your site a name such as "Trey Research legal documents" 1️⃣ and click "Next" 2️⃣.

![The UI to provide name, description, and other details for the target site to create.](../../assets/images/extend-m365-copilot-05/upload-docs-05.png)

Then select your privacy settings and language, and click "Create Site"

![The UI to select the privacy settings and the language for the target site.](../../assets/images/extend-m365-copilot-05/upload-docs-06.png)

After a few moments, you will be presented with a new SharePoint site. 

<cc-end-step lab="e3" exercise="1" step="1" />

### Step 2: Upload the sample documents

In the Documents web part, select "See all" to view the document library page.

![The home page of the site with the Documents web part and the 'See all' link highlighted.](../../assets/images/extend-m365-copilot-05/upload-docs-07.png)

Next, click the "Upload" 1️⃣ toolbar button and select "Files" 2️⃣.

![The command bar of the document library with the 'Upload' menu expanded and the 'Files' option selected.](../../assets/images/extend-m365-copilot-05/upload-docs-08.png)

Navigate to your working folder; you will find a directory called **sampleDocs** within. Highlight all the sample documents 1️⃣ and click "Open" 2️⃣.

Make note of the site url, which will resemble "https://&lt;your-tenant&gt;.sharepoint.com/sites/TreyResearchlegaldocuments", as you will need it in the next exercise.

<cc-end-step lab="e3" exercise="1" step="2" />

## Exercise 2: Create the declarative agent

### Step 1: Add the declarative agent JSON to your project

Create a new file called **trey-declarative-agent.json** within your **appPackage** folder. Copy the following JSON into this file and save it.

~~~json
{
    "$schema": "https://developer.microsoft.com/json-schemas/copilot/declarative-agent/v1.3/schema.json",
    "version": "v1.3",
    "name": "Trey Genie Local",
    "description": "You are a handy assistant for consultants at Trey Research, a boutique consultancy specializing in software development and clinical trials. ",
    "instructions": "You are consulting agent. Greet users professionally and introduce yourself as the Trey Genie. Offer assistance with their consulting projects and hours. Remind users of the Trey motto, 'Always be Billing!'. Your primary role is to support consultants by helping them manage their projects and hours. Using the TreyResearch action, you can: You can assist users in retrieving consultant profiles or project details for administrative purposes but do not participate in decisions related to hiring, performance evaluation, or assignments. You can assist users to find consultants data based on their names, project assignments, skills, roles, and certifications. You can assist users to retrieve project details based on the project or client name. You can assist users to charge hours to a project. You can assist users to add a consultant to a project. If a user inquires about the hours they have billed, charged, or worked on a project, rephrase the request to ask about the hours they have delivered. Additionally, you may provide general consulting advice. If there is any confusion, encourage users to consult their Managing Consultant. Avoid providing legal advice.",
    "conversation_starters": [
        {
            "title": "Find consultants",
            "text": "Find consultants with TypeScript skills"
        },
        {
            "title": "My Projects",
            "text": "What projects am I assigned to?"
        },
        {
            "title": "My Hours",
            "text": "How many hours have I delivered on projects this month?"
        }
    ],
    "capabilities": [
        {
            "name": "OneDriveAndSharePoint",
            "items_by_url": [
                {
                    "url": "${{SHAREPOINT_DOCS_URL}}"
                }
            ]
        }
    ],
    "actions": [
        {
            "id": "treyresearch",
            "file": "trey-plugin.json"
        }
    ]
}
~~~

Notice that the file includes a name, description, and instructions for the declarative agent. Notice that as part of the instructions, Copilot is instructed to "Always remind users of the Trey motto, 'Always be Billing!'." You should see this when you prompt Copilot in the next exercise.

<cc-end-step lab="e3" exercise="2" step="1" />

### Step 2: Add the URL of your SharePoint site to the declarative agent

Under "Capabilities" you will notice a SharePoint file container. While Microsoft 365 Copilot may reference any documents in SharePoint or OneDrive, this declarative agent will only access files in the Trey Research Legal Documents site you created in Exercise 1. 

~~~json
"capabilities": [
    {
        "name": "OneDriveAndSharePoint",
        "items_by_url": [
            {
                    "url": "${{SHAREPOINT_DOCS_URL}}"
            }
        ]
    }
],
~~~

Notice that the SharePoint URL is actually an environment variable `SHAREPOINT_DOCS_URL`, so you need to add that to your **.env.local** file in the **env** folder. Add this in its own line at the end of the file, using your SharePoint URL:

~~~text
SHAREPOINT_DOCS_URL=https://mytenant.sharepoint.com/sites/TreyResearchLegaldocuments
~~~

<cc-end-step lab="e3" exercise="2" step="2" />


### Step 3: Examine the API Plugin files

Within the **trey-declarative-agent.json** file, you'll find an "actions" section, which tells the declarative agent to access the Trey Research API.

~~~json
"actions": [
    {
        "id": "treyresearch",
        "file": "trey-plugin.json"
    }
]
~~~

In this step we'll look at **trey-plugin.json** and how it and another file describe the API to Copilot so it can make the REST calls.

These two files are used to describe your API to Copilot. They were already included in the project you downloaded in Lab 2, so you can examine them now:

 * [**appPackage/trey-definition.json**](https://github.com/microsoft/copilot-camp/blob/main/src/extend-m365-copilot/path-e-lab03-build-declarative-agent/trey-research-lab03-END/appPackage/trey-definition.json){target=_blank} - This is the [OpenAPI Specification (OAS)](https://swagger.io/specification/){target=_blank} or "Swagger" file, which is an industry standard format for describing a REST API
 * [**appPackage/trey-plugin.json**](https://github.com/microsoft/copilot-camp/blob/main/src/extend-m365-copilot/path-e-lab03-build-declarative-agent/trey-research-lab03-END/appPackage/trey-plugin.json){target=_blank} - This file contains all the Copilot-specific details that aren't described in the OAS file

 In this step, take a moment to examine these files. In the next few labs you'll get to know them better as we add more features to the solution.

 In **appPackage/trey-definition.json**, you'll find the general description of the application. This includes the server URL; Agents Toolkit will create a [developer tunnel](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/){target=_blank} to expose your local API on the Internet, and replace the token `"${{OPENAPI_SERVER_URL}}` with the public URL. It then goes on to describe every resource path, verb, and paremeter in the API. Notice the detailed descriptions; these are important to help Copilot understand how the API is to be used.

~~~json
{
  "openapi": "3.0.1",
  "info": {
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "title": "Trey Research API",
      "description": "API to streamline consultant assignment and project management."
  },
  "servers": [
      {
          "url": "${{OPENAPI_SERVER_URL}}/api/",
          "description": "Production server"
      }
  ],
  "paths": {
      "/consultants/": {
          "get": {
              "operationId": "getConsultants",
              "summary": "Get consultants working at Trey Research based on consultant name, project name, certifications, skills, roles and hours available",
              "description": "Returns detailed information about consultants identified from filters like name of the consultant, name of project, certifications, skills, roles and hours available. Multiple filters can be used in combination to refine the list of consultants returned",
              "parameters": [
                  {
                      "name": "consultantName",
                      "in": "query",
                      "description": "Name of the consultant to retrieve",
                      "required": false,
                      "schema": {
                          "type": "string"
                      }
                  },
      ...
~~~

The **appPackage/trey-plugin.json** file has the Copilot-specific details. This includes breaking the API calls down into _functions_ which can be called when Copilot has a particular use case. For example, all GET requests for `/consultants` look up one or more consultants with various parameter options, and they are grouped into a function `getConsultants`:

~~~json
  "functions": [
    {
      "name": "getConsultants",
      "description": "Returns detailed information about consultants identified from filters like name of the consultant, name of project, certifications, skills, roles and hours available. Multiple filters can be used in combination to refine the list of consultants returned",
      "capabilities": {
        "response_semantics": {
          "data_path": "$.results",
          "properties": {
            "title": "$.name",
            "subtitle": "$.id",
            "url": "$.consultantPhotoUrl"
          }
        }
      }
    },
~~~

Scrolling down you can find the runtime settings: 

~~~json
"runtimes": [
  {
    "type": "OpenApi",
    "auth": {
      "type": "None"
    },
    "spec": {
      "url": "trey-definition.json"
    },
    "run_for_functions": [
      "getConsultants",
      "getUserInformation",
      "postBillhours"
    ]
  }
],
~~~

They include a pointer to the **trey-definition.json** file, and an enumeration of the available functions.

<cc-end-step lab="e3" exercise="2" step="3" />

### Step 4: Add the declarative agent to your app manifest

Now open the **manifest.json** file within the **appPackage** directory. Add, just before the `staticTabs` object, a new `copilotAgents` object with a `declarativeAgents` object inside as follows, so it references the declarative agent JSON file you created in the previous step.

~~~json
  "copilotAgents": {
    "declarativeAgents": [
      {
        "id": "treygenie",
        "file": "trey-declarative-agent.json"
      }
    ]
  }, 
~~~

Be sure to save your work. 

<cc-end-step lab="e3" exercise="2" step="4" />

### Step 5: Remove the dummy feature from the app manifest

The initial solution that you ran in Lab E2 didn't have a declarative agent yet, so the manifest would not install because it had no features. So we added a "dummy" feature, which is a static tab pointing to the Copilot Developer Camp home page. This would allow users to view the Copilot Developer Camp web site in a tab within Teams, Outlook, and the the Microsoft 365 app ([https://office.com](https://office.com){target=_blank}).

If you ever tried [Teams App Camp](https://aka.ms/app-camp){target=_blank} you would know all about them. If not, don't worry about it, just delete these lines from **manifest.json** as they aren't needed anymore.

~~~json
"staticTabs": [
  {
    "entityId": "index",
    "name": "Copilot Camp",
    "contentUrl": "https://microsoft.github.io/copilot-camp/",
    "websiteUrl": "https://microsoft.github.io/copilot-camp/",
    "scopes": [
      "personal"
    ]
  }
],
"validDomains": [
  "microsoft.github.io"
],
~~~

<cc-end-step lab="e3" exercise="2" step="5" />

## Exercise 3: Run and test the declarative agent

### Step 1: Run the new project

If you're still in the debugger, stop it to force a complete re-deloyment.

Then start the debugger by clicking the arrow or pressing F5 and return to the Copilot user interface.

<cc-end-step lab="e3" exercise="3" step="1" />

### Step 2: Test the declarative agent

Open the Copilot chat and the right flyout 1️⃣ to show your previous chats and declarative agents and select the Trey Genie Local agent 2️⃣.

![Microsoft 365 Copilot showing the Trey Genie agent in action. On the right side there is the custom declarative agent, together with other agents. In the main body of the page there are the conversation starters and the textbox to provide a prompt to the agent.](../../assets/images/extend-m365-copilot-05/run-declarative-copilot-01.png)

Try a prompt such as "Please list my projects along with details from the Statement of Work doc". 
You should see a list of your projects from the API plugin, enhanced with details from each project's Statement of Work 1️⃣. Notice that Copilot includes the Trey Research motto 2️⃣ and references to the documents 3️⃣. Click one of the references to check out the document.

![The output of the declarative agent with information about projects the user is working on, reference documents from the SharePoint site, and the motto 'Always be Billing!'](../../assets/images/extend-m365-copilot-05/run-declarative-copilot-02.png)

!!! note
    If the SharePoint documents aren't referenced, perhaps there is an issue accessing the files. Has there been time for Search to index the site? Does the end user have permission to the site? Has an administrator excluded the site from Search? Try doing a Search (outside of Copilot) such as 
    
    `woodgrove path:"https://<tenant>.sharepoint.com/sites/<sitename>"`
    
    filling in your tenant and site name to match the one in the capability. You should see three Woodgrove documents; if you don't you need to troubleshoot Search since Copilot won't be able to find them either.
