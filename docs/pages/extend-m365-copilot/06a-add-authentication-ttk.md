## Exercise 1: Update the local Agents Toolkit configuration

In this exercise you will modify the Agents Toolkit configuration files to instruct it to register the application in Entra ID and to place the information in the Teams Developer Portal "vault".

### Step 1: Add an Entra ID app manifest

Create a new file **aad.manifest.json** in the root of your working folder. Copy these lines into this file.

```json
{
    "id": "${{AAD_APP_OBJECT_ID}}",
    "appId": "${{AAD_APP_CLIENT_ID}}",
    "name": "Trey-Research-OAuth-aad",
    "accessTokenAcceptedVersion": 2,
    "signInAudience": "AzureADMyOrg",
    "optionalClaims": {
        "idToken": [],
        "accessToken": [
            {
                "name": "idtyp",
                "source": null,
                "essential": false,
                "additionalProperties": []
            }
        ],
        "saml2Token": []
    },
    "oauth2Permissions": [
        {
            "adminConsentDescription": "Allows Copilot to access the Trey Research API on the user's behalf.",
            "adminConsentDisplayName": "Access Trey Research API",
            "id": "${{AAD_APP_ACCESS_AS_USER_PERMISSION_ID}}",
            "isEnabled": true,
            "type": "User",
            "userConsentDescription": "Allows Copilot to access the Trey Research API on your behalf.",
            "userConsentDisplayName": "Access Trey Research API",
            "value": "access_as_user"
        }
    ],
    "replyUrlsWithType": [
        {
           "url": "https://teams.microsoft.com/api/platform/v1.0/oAuthRedirect",
           "type": "Web"
        }
    ],
    "identifierUris": [
        "api://${{AAD_APP_CLIENT_ID}}"
    ]
}
```

This file contains details for the Entra ID application to be registered or updated. Notice that it contains various tokens such as `${{AAD_APP_CLIENT_ID}}` which will be replaced with actual values when Agents Toolkit provisions the application.

!!! Note
    Entra ID was previously called "Azure Active Directory"; references to "AAD" refer to Entra ID under its old name.

<cc-end-step lab="e6a" exercise="1" step="1" />

### Step 2: Update the file version number in **teamsapp.local.yml**

The **teamsapp.local.yml** file contains instructions for Agents Toolkit for running and debugging your solution locally. This is the file you will update in remainder of this exercise.

!!! info "teamsapp.local.yml is now m365agents.local.yml"
    The new Agents toolkit renamed the file for all toolkit related tasks to `m365agents.local.yml`. So if you started off creating agents with new Agents Toolkit, this will be the file name you will change. For these labs, since you work on existing agent project, there is nothing you need to rename or refactor. Proceed as per the steps.

!!! warning Indentation is critical in yaml
    Editing yaml files is sometimes tricky because containment is indicated by indentation. Be sure to indent properly when making each change or the lab won't work. If in doubt, you can refer to the completed solution file [here](https://github.com/microsoft/copilot-camp/tree/main/src/extend-m365-copilot/path-e-lab06a-add-oauth/trey-research-lab06a-END/teamsapp.local.yml){_target=blank}.

These labs were originally written using a slightly older version of Agents Toolkit, which uses version 1.5 of this file. In this step you will update the file to version 1.7.

Begin by replacing the first line with this new schema reference:

```yaml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://aka.ms/teams-toolkit/v1.7/yaml.schema.json
```

Then on the 4th line, update the version number to 1.7.

```yaml
version: v1.7
```

<cc-end-step lab="e6a" exercise="1" step="2" />

### Step 3: Provision an Entra ID application

In order for an application to authenticate a user and authorize it to do something, the application must first be registered in Entra ID. In this step we'll add this app registration if it's not already present.

Locate these lines in the file:

```yaml
provision:
  # Creates a Teams app
```
Insert the following yaml between these lines, directly under the `provision:` line. You may leave blank lines for readability if you wish.

```yaml
  # Creates a new Microsoft Entra app to authenticate users if
  # the environment variable that stores clientId is empty
  - uses: aadApp/create
    with:
      # Note: when you run aadApp/update, the Microsoft Entra app name will be updated
      # based on the definition in manifest. If you don't want to change the
      # name, make sure the name in Microsoft Entra manifest is the same with the name
      # defined here.
      name: trey-oauth-aad
      # If the value is false, the action will not generate client secret for you
      generateClientSecret: true
      # Authenticate users with a Microsoft work or school account in your
      # organization's Microsoft Entra tenant (for example, single tenant).
      signInAudience: AzureADMyOrg
    # Write the information of created resources into environment file for the
    # specified environment variable(s).
    writeToEnvironmentFile:
      clientId: AAD_APP_CLIENT_ID
      # Environment variable that starts with `SECRET_` will be stored to the
      # .env.{envName}.user environment file
      clientSecret: SECRET_AAD_APP_CLIENT_SECRET
      objectId: AAD_APP_OBJECT_ID
      tenantId: AAD_APP_TENANT_ID
      authority: AAD_APP_OAUTH_AUTHORITY
      authorityHost: AAD_APP_OAUTH_AUTHORITY_HOST
```

Notice that by setting `signInAudience` to `AzureADMyOrg`, Agents Toolkit creates a single tenant application that can only be used within the Entra ID tenant where it is registered. If you want to allow the app to be used in other tenants, such as your customer's tenants, you would set this to `AzureADMultipleOrgs`. All three steps use the **aad.manifest.json** file you created in the previous step.

Also note that this step will write several values into your environment files, where they will be inserted into **aad.manifest.json** as well as in your application package.

<cc-end-step lab="e6a" exercise="1" step="3" />

### Step 4: Update the Entra ID application

Locate this line in **teamsapp.local.yml**
```yaml
  # Build Teams app package with latest env value
```

Insert the following yaml before this line:

```yaml
  - uses: oauth/register
    with:
      name: oAuth2AuthCode
      flow: authorizationCode
      appId: ${{TEAMS_APP_ID}}
      clientId: ${{AAD_APP_CLIENT_ID}}
      clientSecret: ${{SECRET_AAD_APP_CLIENT_SECRET}}
      # Path to OpenAPI description document
      apiSpecPath: ./appPackage/trey-definition.json
    writeToEnvironmentFile:
      configurationId: OAUTH2AUTHCODE_CONFIGURATION_ID

  - uses: oauth/update
    with:
      name: oAuth2AuthCode
      appId: ${{TEAMS_APP_ID}}
      clientId: ${{AAD_APP_CLIENT_ID}}
      # Path to OpenAPI description document
      apiSpecPath: ./appPackage/trey-definition.json
      configurationId: ${{OAUTH2AUTHCODE_CONFIGURATION_ID}}

  # Apply the Microsoft Entra manifest to an existing Microsoft Entra app. Will use the object id in
  # manifest file to determine which Microsoft Entra app to update.
  - uses: aadApp/update
    with:
      # Relative path to this file. Environment variables in manifest will
      # be replaced before apply to Microsoft Entra app
      manifestPath: ./aad.manifest.json
      outputFilePath: ./build/aad.manifest.${{TEAMSFX_ENV}}.json
```

The `oauth/register` and `oauth/update` steps will register the application in the Teams Developer Portal's vault, where Copilot can obtain the necessary details to implement the OAuth 2.0 Auth Code authorization flow. The `aadApp/update` step will update the Entra ID application itself with the details for this app. These details are in a separte file, **aad.manifest.json**, which we'll add in the next exercise.

<cc-end-step lab="e6a" exercise="1" step="4" />

### Step 5: Change the output path

The new yaml schema changes the output path slightly. Locate this line:

```yaml
      outputJsonPath: ./appPackage/build/manifest.${{TEAMSFX_ENV}}.json
```

and replace it with this one:

```yaml
      outputFolder: ./appPackage/build
```

<cc-end-step lab="e6a" exercise="1" step="5" />

### Step 6: Make the Entra ID values available to your application code

Locate these lines:

```yaml
deploy:
  # Install development tool(s)
  - uses: devTool/install
    with:
      func:
        version: ~4.0.5530
        symlinkDir: ./devTools/func
    # Write the information of installed development tool(s) into environment
    # file for the specified environment variable(s).
    writeToEnvironmentFile:
      funcPath: FUNC_PATH
          # Generate runtime environment variables
  - uses: file/createOrUpdateEnvironmentFile
    with:
      target: ./.localConfigs
      envs:
        STORAGE_ACCOUNT_CONNECTION_STRING: ${{SECRET_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_CONNECTION_STRING}}
```

This code publishes environment variables for use within your application code. Add these lines under the `STORAGE_ACCOUNT_CONNECTION_STRING` to make them available:

```yaml
        AAD_APP_TENANT_ID: ${{AAD_APP_TENANT_ID}}
        AAD_APP_CLIENT_ID: ${{AAD_APP_CLIENT_ID}}
```

<cc-end-step lab="e6a" exercise="1" step="6" />

## Exercise 2: Update the general Agents Toolkit configuration

While **teamsapp-local.yml** controls Agents Toolkit behavior when debugging locally, **teamsapp.yml**
controls its behavior when deploying to Microsoft Azure. In this exercise you'll update this file.

!!! warning Indentation is critical in yaml
    Editing yaml files is sometimes tricky because containment is indicated by indentation. Be sure to indent properly when making each change or the lab won't work. If in doubt, you can refer to the completed solution file [here](https://github.com/microsoft/copilot-camp/tree/main/src/extend-m365-copilot/path-e-lab06a-add-oauth/trey-research-lab06a-END/teamsapp.yml){_target=blank}.

### Step 1: Provision an Entra ID application

In order for an application to authenticate a user and authorize it to do something, the application must first be registered in Entra ID. In this step we'll add this app registration if it's not already present.

Locate these lines in the file:

```yaml
provision:
  # Creates a Teams app
```
Insert the following yaml between these lines, directly under the `provision:` line. You may leave blank lines for readability if you wish.

```yaml
  # Creates a new Microsoft Entra app to authenticate users if
  # the environment variable that stores clientId is empty
  - uses: aadApp/create
    with:
      # Note: when you run aadApp/update, the Microsoft Entra app name will be updated
      # based on the definition in manifest. If you don't want to change the
      # name, make sure the name in Microsoft Entra manifest is the same with the name
      # defined here.
      name: Repairs-OAuth-aad
      # If the value is false, the action will not generate client secret for you
      generateClientSecret: true
      # Authenticate users with a Microsoft work or school account in your
      # organization's Microsoft Entra tenant (for example, single tenant).
      signInAudience: AzureADMyOrg
    # Write the information of created resources into environment file for the
    # specified environment variable(s).
    writeToEnvironmentFile:
      clientId: AAD_APP_CLIENT_ID
      # Environment variable that starts with `SECRET_` will be stored to the
      # .env.{envName}.user environment file
      clientSecret: SECRET_AAD_APP_CLIENT_SECRET
      objectId: AAD_APP_OBJECT_ID
      tenantId: AAD_APP_TENANT_ID
      authority: AAD_APP_OAUTH_AUTHORITY
      authorityHost: AAD_APP_OAUTH_AUTHORITY_HOST
```

Notice that by setting `signInAudience` to `AzureADMyOrg`, Agents Toolkit creates a single tenant application that can only be used within the Entra ID tenant where it is registered. If you want to allow the app to be used in other tenants, such as your customer's tenants, you would set this to `AzureADMultipleOrgs`. All three steps use the **aad.manifest.json** file you created in the previous step.

Also note that this step will write several values into your environment files, where they will be inserted into **aad.manifest.json** as well as in your application package.

<cc-end-step lab="e6a" exercise="2" step="1" />

### Step 2: Register the app in the Teams Developer Portal Vault

Locate these lines in **teamsapp.yml**

```yaml
  # Validate using manifest schema
  # - uses: teamsApp/validateManifest
  #   with:
  #     # Path to manifest template
  #     manifestPath: ./appPackage/manifest.json

  # Build Teams app package with latest env value
```

Insert the following before the last line:

```yaml
  # Apply the Microsoft Entra manifest to an existing Microsoft Entra app. Will use the object id in
  # manifest file to determine which Microsoft Entra app to update.
  - uses: aadApp/update
    with:
      # Relative path to this file. Environment variables in manifest will
      # be replaced before apply to Microsoft Entra app
      manifestPath: ./aad.manifest.json
      outputFilePath: ./build/aad.manifest.${{TEAMSFX_ENV}}.json

  - uses: oauth/register
    with:
      name: oAuth2AuthCode
      flow: authorizationCode
      appId: ${{TEAMS_APP_ID}}
      clientId: ${{AAD_APP_CLIENT_ID}}
      clientSecret: ${{SECRET_AAD_APP_CLIENT_SECRET}}
      # Path to OpenAPI description document
      apiSpecPath: ./appPackage/trey-definition.json
    writeToEnvironmentFile:
      configurationId: OAUTH2AUTHCODE_CONFIGURATION_ID
```

<cc-end-step lab="e6a" exercise="2" step="2" />

## Exercise 3: Update your application package

Now that you've got Agents Toolkit setting up the Entra ID registrations, it's time to update the application package so Copilot knows about the authentication. In this exercise you'll update the necessary files.

### Step 1: Update the Open API Specification file

Open your working folder in Visual Studio Code. In the **appPackage** folder, open the **trey-definition.json** file. Locate the line:

```json
    "paths": {
```

and insert the following JSON before it:

```json
    "components": {
        "securitySchemes": {
            "oAuth2AuthCode": {
                "type": "oauth2",
                "description": "OAuth configuration for the Trey Research service",
                "flows": {
                    "authorizationCode": {
                        "authorizationUrl": "https://login.microsoftonline.com/${{AAD_APP_TENANT_ID}}/oauth2/v2.0/authorize",
                        "tokenUrl": "https://login.microsoftonline.com/${{AAD_APP_TENANT_ID}}/oauth2/v2.0/token",
                        "scopes": {
                            "api://${{AAD_APP_CLIENT_ID}}/access_as_user": "Access Trey Research API as the user"
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    },
```

This sets up a new security scheme to be used when calling the API.

Now you need to add this scheme to each API path. Find each instance of a path and look for the `responses` object:

```json
    "responses": {
      ...
```

Insert the following JSON before each of the `responses` (you will find 5 of them in the file; make sure you insert this before each one):

```json
    "security": [
        {
            "oAuth2AuthCode": []
        }
    ],
```

Be sure to save your changes after editing.

<cc-end-step lab="e6a" exercise="3" step="1" />

### Step 2: Update the Plugin file

In the **appPackage** folder, open the **trey-plugin.json** file. This is where information is stored that Copilot needs, but is not already in the Open API Specification (OAS) file.

Under `Runtimes` you will find an `auth` property with `type` of `"None"`, indicating the API is currently not authenticated. Change it as follows to tell Copilot to authenticate using the OAuth settings you saved in the vault.

~~~json
  "auth": {
    "type": "OAuthPluginVault",
    "reference_id": "${{OAUTH2AUTHCODE_CONFIGURATION_ID}}"
  },
~~~

In the next step you'll update the application code to check for a valid login and access the API as the actual Microsoft 365 user instead of "Avery Howard" (which is a name from Microsoft's fictitious name generator).

<cc-end-step lab="e6a" exercise="3" step="2" />

## Exercise 4: Update the application code

### Step 1: Install the JWT validation library

From a command line in your working directory, type:

~~~sh
npm i jwt-validate
~~~

This will install a library for validating the incoming Entra ID authorization token.

!!! warning
    Microsoft does not provide a supported library for validating Entra ID tokens in NodeJS, but instead provides [this detailed documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity-platform/access-tokens#validate-tokens){target=_blank} on how to write your own. [Another useful article](https://www.voitanos.io/blog/validating-entra-id-generated-oauth-tokens/){target=_blank} is also available from [Microsoft MVP Andrew Connell](https://www.voitanos.io/pages/about/#whos-behind-voitanos){target=_blank}.

    **This lab uses a [community provided library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jwt-validate){target=_blank} written by [Waldek Mastykarz](https://github.com/waldekmastykarz){target=_blank}, which is intended to follow this guidance. Note that this library is not supported by Microsoft and is under an MIT License, so use it at your own risk.**
    
    If you want to track progress on a supported library, please follow [this Github issue](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/issues/6113){target=_blank}.

<cc-end-step lab="e6a" exercise="4" step="1" />

### Step 2: Update the identity service

At this point, OAuth login should work and provide a valid access token, but the solution isn't secure unless the code checks to make sure the token is valid. In this step, you'll add code to validate the is token and extract information such as the user's name and ID.

In the **src/services** folder, open **IdentityService.ts**. 
At the top of the file along with the other `import` statements, add this one:

~~~typescript
import { TokenValidator, ValidateTokenOptions, getEntraJwksUri } from 'jwt-validate';
~~~

Then, right under the `class Identity` statement, add this line:

~~~typescript
    private validator: TokenValidator;
~~~

Now look for the comment

~~~typescript
// ** INSERT REQUEST VALIDATION HERE (see Lab E6) **
~~~

Replace the comment with this code:

~~~typescript
  // Try to validate the token and get user's basic information
  try {
      const { AAD_APP_CLIENT_ID, AAD_APP_TENANT_ID } = process.env;
      const token = req.headers.get("Authorization")?.split(" ")[1];
      if (!token) {
          throw new HttpError(401, "Authorization token not found");
      }

      // create a new token validator for the Microsoft Entra common tenant
      if (!this.validator) {
        // We need a new validator object which we will continue to use on subsequent
        // requests so it can cache the Entra ID signing keys
        // For multitenant, use:
        // const entraJwksUri = await getEntraJwksUri();
        const entraJwksUri = await getEntraJwksUri(AAD_APP_TENANT_ID);
        this.validator = new TokenValidator({
            jwksUri: entraJwksUri
        });
        console.log ("Token validator created");
      }

      const options: ValidateTokenOptions = {
          allowedTenants: [AAD_APP_TENANT_ID],
          audience: `${AAD_APP_CLIENT_ID}`,
          issuer: `https://login.microsoftonline.com/${AAD_APP_TENANT_ID}/v2.0`,
          scp: ["access_as_user"]
      };

      // validate the token
      const validToken = await this.validator.validateToken(token, options);

      userId = validToken.oid;
      userName = validToken.name;
      userEmail = validToken.preferred_username;
      console.log(`Request ${this.requestNumber++}: Token is valid for user ${userName} (${userId})`);
  }
  catch (ex) {
      // Token is missing or invalid - return a 401 error
      console.error(ex);
      throw new HttpError(401, "Unauthorized");
  }
~~~

!!! Note "Learn from the code"
    Have a look at the new source code. First, it obtains the token from the `Authorization` header in the HTTPs request. This header contains the word "Bearer", a space, and then the token, so a JavaScript `split(" ")` is used to obtain only the token.

    Also note that the code will throw an exception if authentication should fail for any reason; the Azure function will then return
    the appropriate error.

    The code then creates a validator for use with the `jwks-validate` library. This call reads the latest private keys from Entra ID, so it is an async call that may take some time to run.

    Next, the code sets up a `ValidateTokenOptions` object. Based on this object, in addition to validating that the token was signed with Entra ID's private key, the library will validate that:

    * the _audience_ must be the same as the API service app URI; this ensures that the token is intended for our web service and no other

    * the _issuer_ must be from the security token service for our tenant

    * the _scope_ must match the scope defined in our app registration, which is `"access_as_user"`.

    If the token is valid, the library returns an object with all the "claims" that were inside, including the user's unique ID, name, and email. We will use these values instead of relying on the fictitious "Avery Howard".

## Exercise 5: Test the application

### Step 1: Bump the application version number in the app manifest

Before you test the application, update the manifest version of your app package in the `appPackage\manifest.json` file, follow these steps:

1. Open the `manifest.json` file located in the `appPackage` folder of your project.

2. Locate the `version` field in the JSON file. It should look something like this:  
   ```json
   "version": "1.0.0"
   ```

3. Increment the version number to a small increment. For example, change it to:  
   ```json
   "version": "1.0.1"
   ```

4. Save the file after making the change.

!!! warning "Compile issue with jwt-validate package "
    At the moment, the jwt-validate package throws typing error for @types/jsonwebtoken package. To work around the issue, edit the tsconfig.json file, found at the root of the project, and add "skipLibCheck":true. This will be fixed in a future version of the library, and may no longer be necessary by the time you do the lab.

### Step 2: (Re)start the application

If your app is still running from an earlier lab, stop it to force it to re-create the application package.

Then press F5 to run the application again, and install it as before.

<cc-end-step lab="e6a" exercise="5" step="2" />

### Step 3: Run the declarative agent

Proceed back to Microsoft 365 Copilot and select the Trey Research agent.
Enter the prompt, "What Trey projects am I assigned to?". You may see a confirmation card asking if it's OK to call your API. No authentication is happening here; click "Allow Once" to proceed.

![Microsoft 365 Copilot showing a confirmation card asking if it is ok to call your API. There are buttons to 'Always allow', 'Allow once', or 'Cancel.'](../../assets/images/extend-m365-copilot-06/oauth-run-01small.png)

The confirmation card will be replaced with a login card.
Click "Sign in to Trey" to sign in. At first you should see a pop-up window asking you to log in and to consent to permissions. On subsequent vists this may be hidden as your credentials have been cached by Entra ID in your local browser.

![Microsoft 365 Copilot showing a login card with a button to 'Sign in to Trey' and another one to 'Cancel.'](../../assets/images/extend-m365-copilot-06/oauth-run-02small.png)

!!! tip "You might need admin approval"
    There are cases where your admin has not allowed you to consent as a user and may see something like below:

    ![The Microsoft Entra popup dialog asking for an admin approval to consume the API.](../../assets/images/extend-m365-copilot-06/need-admin-approval.png)

    This is because the admin has restricted the ability for users to consent to grant permissions to applications. In this case, you have to request admin to manually grant global consent for all users for the plugin API registration as below. Find the app registration in Microsoft 365 Admin / Identity / Applications / App Registrations and do the consent from there.

    ![The 'API permissions' page of the 'API Plugin' application registered in Microsoft Entra with the 'Grant admin consent ...' command highlighted.](../../assets/images/extend-m365-copilot-06/approval-admin.png)

The login card should be replaced by Copilot's response to your prompt. Since you were just added to the database, you aren't assigned to any projects.

Recall that the user was hard coded to the fictitious user "Avery Howard". When the new code runs for the first time, it won't find your user ID, so it will create a new consultant record that's not (yet) assigned to any projects.

!!! note "Updating your user information"
    Since this is just a lab, we have hard-coded the details such as skills and location for your new user account. If you want to change them, you can do that using the [Azure Storage Explorer](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/storage/storage-explorer/){target=_blank}

    ![The Azure Storage Explorer in action while editing the Consultant table. The actual current user is highlighted.](../../assets/images/extend-m365-copilot-06/oauth-azure-storage-explorer.png)
    
<cc-end-step lab="e6a" exercise="5" step="3" />

### Step 4: Add yourself to a project

Since you were just added to the database, you're not assigned to any projects. Note that project assignments are stored in the `Assignment` table and reference the project ID and the assigned consultant's consultant ID.
When you ask Agent what projects you are asigned to, it says it cannot find any project assigned but identifies your skills and roles and offers to help.

![The response from the 'Trey Genie' agent when the actual user doesn't have any assigned project.](../../assets/images/extend-m365-copilot-06/oauth-run-03bsmall.png)

Ask Agent to add you to the Woodgrove project. Agent will press you for details if you forgot to include any required values.

![The response from the 'Trey Genie' agent when adding the current user to a project. If some information are missing, Copilot asks to confirm them. Once all the information are provided, the agent provides a confirmation of the action.](../../assets/images/extend-m365-copilot-06/oauth-run-05.png)

You would want to provide missing information, so your agent can confirm the details again before proceeding.

Once all the information are provided, the agent provides a confirmation of the action.](../../assets/images/extend-m365-copilot-06/oauth-run-06.png)

Finally once you confirm, agent fullfills the task by adding you to the project with right role and forecast.

![The response from the 'Trey Genie' agent after adding user to project](../../assets/images/extend-m365-copilot-06/oauth-run-07.png)

Now check out your default skills and confirm the project assignment by asking, "What are my skills and what projects am I assigned to?"
