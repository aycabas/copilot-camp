In this path of Extend, you will learn how to use Teams Message Extensions as plugins in Microsoft 365 Copilot. You will start with a working message extension sample available in the sample[ source code](https://github.com/microsoft/copilot-camp/tree/main/src/extend-message-ext/Lab01-Run-NW-Teams/Northwind) and run it as a plugin in Microsoft 365 Copilot. You will also enhance the code to add some extra features.
