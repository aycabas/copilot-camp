**Copilot Developer Camp** is a self-paced learning resource, designed to help you build agents for Microsoft 365 Copilot. It provides practical guidance and real-world examples to support your development journey.

# Building Agents for Microsoft 365

Agents for Microsoft 365 are conversational AI-powered assistants designed to help users automate tasks, answer questions, and streamline workflows across Microsoft 365 apps and services. Agents can be used in various scenarios, such as customer support, IT helpdesk, HR support, and more.

An agent for Microsoft 365 is typically made up of these components‚Äîfoundational model,  an orchestrator, which is running that taps into that knowledge, skills, and autonomous processes that it has those capabilities to do, and it may or may not have a user interface. ‚Äã

You can either extend Microsoft 365 Copilot by using the same infrastructure, orchestrator, foundation model, and security controls as Microsoft 365 Copilot, which ensures a consistent and familiar user experience.

Or you can pick your own foundation model, orchestrator, and responsible AI controls.

## üß™ Where should I start to build agents?

There are three major pathways with several labs. If you want a no-code/low-code approach, choose the **Maker** path ("MAB", "MSA", or "MCS" lab). If you want to extend Microsoft 365 Copilot, choose the **Extend** path ("E" lab). If you want to build a completely custom agent using Azure AI Foundry or any AI of your choice, choose the **Build** path ("BMA" or "BTA" lab).

## üÜï What's New?

!!! example "Updated in June 2025"

    We‚Äôre excited to introduce **four new hands-on labs** designed to help you build powerful Copilot experiences. 

    - **Build with Microsoft 365 Agents SDK**:
    Leverage the full capabilities of the Microsoft 365 Agents SDK to create production-ready Copilot agents that integrate with real business data.
    [üîó Start this lab](https://microsoft.github.io/copilot-camp/pages/custom-engine/agents-sdk/)

    - **Build Copilot Agents Using TypeSpec**:
    Use TypeSpec to define your agent and capabilities declaratively. Ideal for developers looking to build Copilot agents that connect to API services with seamless orchestration.
    [üîó Start this lab](https://microsoft.github.io/copilot-camp/pages/extend-m365-copilot/01-typespec-declarative-agent/)

    - **Agent Instructions Guide for Beginners**:
    New to Copilot? This lab walks you through the process of writing effective natural language instructions and testing your Copilot agent in a guided environment.
    [üîó Start this lab](https://microsoft.github.io/copilot-camp/pages/beyond-agents/beginner-agent/)

    - **SharePoint agents**:
    Learn how to create SharePoint agents starting from the basics, how to fine tune their settings, and how to share them with people or in Microsoft Teams group chats.
