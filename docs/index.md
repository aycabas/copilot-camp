## üß™ Where should I start?

The labs are divided into three pathways, allowing you to choose based on what you want to create. If you want to use Microsoft Copilot Studio and a no-code/low-code approach, choose the "Maker" labs. If you want to extend Microsoft 365 Copilot, building on its AI engine and orchestration, choose the "Extend" labs. If you want to build a completely custom agent using Azure AI Foundry (or any AI of your choice), choose the "Build" labs.
