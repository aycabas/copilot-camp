## Get started with the Repair Service Agent

> **Prerequisites**
>
> To run this app template in your local dev machine, you will need:
>
> - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), supported versions: 18, 20, 22
> - A [Microsoft 365 account for development](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/accounts).
> - [Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit Visual Studio Code Extension](https://aka.ms/teams-toolkit) version 5.0.0 and higher or [Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit CLI](https://aka.ms/teamsfx-toolkit-cli)
> - [Microsoft 365 Copilot license](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365-copilot/extensibility/prerequisites#prerequisites)



1. First, select the Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit icon on the left in the VS Code toolbar.
2. In the Account section, sign in with your [Microsoft 365 account](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/accounts) if you haven't already.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies before working with TypeSpec files.
4. Update the [`main.tsp`](./main.tsp) to configure your agent and its plugins. This is the default entry point for TypeSpec files. 
5. Create app by clicking `Provision` in "Lifecycle" section.
6. Select `Preview in Copilot (Edge)` or `Preview in Copilot (Chrome)` from the launch configuration dropdown.
