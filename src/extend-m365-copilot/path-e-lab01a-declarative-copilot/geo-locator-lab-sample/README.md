# Geo Locator Game

## Overview

Welcome to the Geo Locator Game! In this interactive geo-location guessing game, you, as the game host, will guide players through a series of clues about a specific city. The goal is to help players guess the city based on the clues you provide. The game features progressive clues, and in special rounds, players will engage with PDF files to enhance their experience.

### Prerequisites
